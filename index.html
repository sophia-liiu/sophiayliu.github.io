          <h3>~Web Development~</h3>
          <p>I started learning how to code at age 11, but I was really inconsistent. I would get really into it but suddenly I'd lose the motivation and forget to do for 6 months... Now I recently turned 13 years old and I'm improving but still a little rusty around the edges of coding but it's going well so far. Like life, There are ups and downs, but I managed to get through my struggles and make my way on becoming a professional Web Designer/Developer :).</p>

          <h3>~HTML~</h3>

          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p>CSS is the second coding language I learned. CSS is one of my favorite coding langueages because you can design a website however you like by using CSS! I grew up on the creative side like most kids and always found a special place in my heart for creating a <em>beautiful</em> materpeice. For example creating a beautiful website, a painting, etc. Seeing things well put together in a beautiful way really satisfies me.blockquote. My understaning of CSS is <b class ="star">5 stars</b>. </p>
